# Performance-of-LLMS-locally-on-edge-computing
Benchmarking compressed LLMs on edge devices Key Technologies: NVIDIA Jetson platform CUDA Quantization techniques GGUF model format Tools &amp; Frameworks: PyTorch on Jetson Hugging Face Transformers Energy monitoring


Why Edge Computing for LLMs Matters
1)Privacy Preservation : Local data processing eliminates network transmission vulnerabilities
2)Latency Reduction : Critical for real-time applications
3)Reliability : Independence from network connectivity
4)Cost Efficiency : Long-term cost amortization vs. API call expenses

Challenges : 
1)Limited computational resources
2)Power constraints
3)Memory limitations
4)Real-time processing requirements
5)Thermal considerations
